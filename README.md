# 📊 SQL Utilities

This repo is a small collection of SQL snippets I use to explore, troubleshoot, and report on system data.  
They’re written to be **safe, simple, and easy to adapt** for different environments.

## ✨ What’s Inside
- `sql/active_users_by_role.sql` – counts active users by role over the last 30 days  
- `sql/error_rate_by_day.sql` – tracks error rates over the last 14 days  
- `sql/top_requests_last_7_days.sql` – lists most-used API endpoints in the last week  
- `docs/usage.md` – quick tips on how to adapt these queries safely

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Open any file in the `sql/` folder.  
2. Copy the snippet into your SQL editor.  
3. Replace table/column names with ones from your environment.  
4. Run against your own database or a sample dataset.

## 🌱 Next Steps
I’ll be adding more queries for common support and analytics use-cases.
